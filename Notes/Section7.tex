\begin{itemize}

  \item Wireless and Mobile Networks: Context

    \begin{itemize}

      \item More wireless (mobile) phone subscribers than fixed (wired) phone subscribers (10-to-1 in 2029)

      \item More mobile-broadband connected devices than fixed-broadband connected devices (5-1 in 2019)

        \begin{itemize}

          \item 4G/5G cellular networks now embracing Internet protocol stack, including SDN

        \end{itemize}

      \item Two important (but different) challenges

        \begin{itemize}

          \item Wireless: communication over wireless link

          \item Mobility: handling the mobile user who changes point of attachment to network

        \end{itemize}

    \end{itemize}

  \item Wireless Hosts

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Laptop, smartphone, IoT device, etc.

      \item Run applications

      \item May be stationary (non-mobile) or mobile

        \begin{itemize}

          \item Wireless does not always mean mobility

        \end{itemize}

    \end{itemize}

  \item Base Station

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Key element that connects the wireless network to wired networks through the backbone link

      \item Relay â€” responsible for sending packets between wired networks and wireless host(s) in its ``area''

        \begin{itemize}

          \item For examples, cell towers, IEEE 802.11, access points

        \end{itemize}

    \end{itemize}

  \item Network Infrastructure

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Larger network with which a wireless host may wish to communicate

      \item Backbone link: connects base station to network infrastructure

    \end{itemize}

  \item Infrastructure Mode

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Each node is associated to the base station

      \item Base station connects wireless hosts into the wired network

      \item Handoff or handover: mobile node changes base station providing connection into wired network (without losing connectivity)

    \end{itemize}

  \item Operating Modes of a Wireless Network

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Ad Hoc Mode

        \begin{itemize}

          \item No base stations

          \item No larger network infrastructure to connect

          \item Nodes can only transmit to other nodes within link coverage

          \item Nodes organize themselves into a network: route among themselves

          \item Development of protocols is challenging

        \end{itemize}

    \end{itemize}

  \item Wireless Link Characteristics

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Decreased signal strength: radio signal attenuates as it propagates through matter (path loss)

      \item Interference from other sources: some wireless network frequencies (like 2.4 GHz) are shared by many devices (like WiFi, Bluetooth, garage openers, motors, etc), which cause interference

      \item Multipath propagation: radio signal reflects off objects and ground, arriving at destination may create different copies of the signal at slightly different times (multipath fading)

      \item Moreover, nodes in the wireless link (broadcast link) do not receive the same signal

    \end{itemize}

  \item WiFi: IEEE 802.11 Wireless LAN

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Many different 802.11 Standards:

        \begin{itemize}

          \item Link layer and physical layer

          \item Most of the IEEE 802.11 standards have infrastructure mode and ad hoc mode network versions

          \item Common MAC protocol

          \item Common frame format

          \item All offer connectionless reliable service with positive ACK and stop and wait at the link layer

          \item Different data rates

          \item All (but one) operate in unlicensed spectrum $\to$ ISM bands (Industrial, Scientific, and Medical bands)

            \begin{itemize}

              \item Open frequency bands for non-exclusive usage (no license required)

            \end{itemize}

        \end{itemize}

    \end{itemize}

\end{itemize}
