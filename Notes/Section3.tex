\begin{itemize}

  \item Transport Services and Protocols

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Provide logical communication between application processes running on different hosts

      \item Transport protocols actions in end systems:

        \begin{itemize}

          \item Sender: breaks application messages into segments, passes to Network layer

          \item Receiver: reassembles segments into messages, passes to Application layer

        \end{itemize}

      \item Two transport protocols available to internet applications

        \begin{enumerate}

          \item TCP

          \item UDP

        \end{enumerate}

    \end{itemize}

  \item Transport vs. Network Layer

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Network layer: logical communication between two hosts

      \item Transport layer: logical communication between processes

        \begin{itemize}

          \item Relies on, enhances, network layer services

        \end{itemize}

    \end{itemize}

  \item Two Internet Transport Protocols

    \begin{itemize}

      \item TCP: Transmission Control Protocol

        \begin{itemize}

          \item Reliable, in-order delivery

          \item Congestion Control

          \item Flow Control

          \item Connection set-up

        \end{itemize}

      \item UDP: User Datagram Protocol

        \begin{itemize}
            
          \item Unreliable, unordered delivery

          \item No-frills extension of ``best-effort'' IP

        \end{itemize}

      \item Services not available:

        \begin{itemize}

          \item Delay guarantees

          \item Throughput guarantees

        \end{itemize}

    \end{itemize}

  \item Multiplexing/Demultiplexing

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Multiplexing at sender: Handle data from multiple sockets, add transport header (later used for demultiplexing)

      \item How demultiplexing works

        \begin{itemize}

          \item Host receives IP packets

            \begin{itemize}

              \item Each packet has source IP address, destination IP address

              \item Each packet carries one transport-layer segment

              \item Each segment has source, destination port number

            \end{itemize}

          \item Host uses IP address and port numbers to direct segment to appropriate socket

        \end{itemize}

      \item Connectionless Demultiplexing

        \begin{itemize}

          \item Create a socket in the client, the Transport layer automatically assigns a host-local port number to the socket

          \item When data is sent into UDP socket, must specify

            \begin{itemize}
                
              \item Destination IP address
                
              \item Destination port number

            \end{itemize}

          \item When a host receives UDP segment, the Transport layer:

            \begin{itemize}

              \item Checks destination port number in segment

              \item Directs UDP segment to socket with that port number

            \end{itemize}

          \item IP datagrams with same destination port number but different source IP addresses and/or source port numbers will be directed to same socket at destination

        \end{itemize}

      \item Connection-Oriented Demultiplexing

        \begin{itemize}

          \item TCP socket identified by 4-tuple:

            \begin{itemize}

              \item Source IP address

              \item Source port number

              \item Destination IP address

              \item Destination port number

            \end{itemize}

          \item Demultiplexing receiver users all four values to direct segment to appropriate socket

          \item A server may support simultaneous TCP sockets:

            \begin{itemize}

              \item Each socket identified by its own 4-tuple

              \item Each socket associated with a different connecting client

            \end{itemize}

          \item Note: the TCP server has a welcoming socket

            \begin{itemize}

              \item Each time a client initiates a TCP connection to the server, a new socket is created for this connection

              \item To support $n$ simultaneous connections, the server would need $n+1$ sockets

            \end{itemize}

        \end{itemize}

    \end{itemize}

  \item Connectionless Transport: UDP

    \begin{itemize}

      \item ``No frills'', ``bare bones'' Internet transport protocol

      \item ``Best effort'' service, UDP segments may be:

        \begin{itemize}

          \item Lost

          \item Delivered out-of-order to application

        \end{itemize}

      \item Connectionless:

        \begin{itemize}

          \item No handshaking between UDP sender, receiver

          \item Each UDP segment handled independently of others

        \end{itemize}

      \item Why is there a UDP?

        \begin{itemize}

          \item No connection establishment (which can add RTT delay)

          \item Simple: no connection state at sender, receiver

          \item Small header size

          \item No congestion control

            \begin{itemize}

              \item UDP can blast away as fast as desired

              \item It can function in the face of congestion

            \end{itemize}

        \end{itemize}

      \item UDP used in:

        \begin{itemize}

          \item Streaming multimedia apps (loss tolerant, rate sensitive)

          \item DNS

          \item HTTP/3

        \end{itemize}

      \item If reliable transfer or other services needed over UDP (like in HTTP/3)

        \begin{itemize}

          \item Add needed reliability at application layer

          \item Add congestion control at application layer

        \end{itemize}

    \end{itemize}

  \item Internet Checksum

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Goal: detect ``errors'' (\textit{e}.\textit{g}.\ flipped bits) in received segment —  optional if UDP segment is encapsulated in IPv4 packet: carries all-zeros if unused

      \item Sender:

        \begin{itemize}

          \item Treat segment contents, including UDP header fields and IP addresses, as sequence of 16-bit words

          \item Checksum: ones complement of the ones complement sum of all 16-bit words

          \item Sender puts checksum value into UDP checksum field

        \end{itemize}

      \item Receiver — error detected?

        \begin{itemize}

          \item All 16-bit words are added, including checksum

          \item Result = $1111111111111111\to$ no error 

            \begin{itemize}

              \item But maybe errors, nonetheless?

            \end{itemize}

          \item Result $\neq1111111111111111\to$ Error

            \begin{itemize}

              \item Do not recover from the error: discard segment or pass damaged data with a warning

            \end{itemize}

        \end{itemize}

    \end{itemize}

  \item Principles of Reliable Data Transfer

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Consider only unidirectional data transfer

      \item But control information will flow in both directions

      \item Incrementally develop sender, receiver sides of reliable data transfer protocol (rdt)

    \end{itemize}

  \item Components of Error Recovery

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Checksum to detect bit errors

      \item Acknowledgments (ACKs): receiver explicitly tells sender the packet received is OK

      \item Negative Acknowledgments (NAKs): receiver explicitly tells sender that pack had errors

      \item Sender retransmits packet on receipt of NAK

      \item What happens if ACK/NAK is corrupted?

        \begin{itemize}

          \item Sender doesn't know what happened at receiver

          \item Can't just retransmit, possible duplicate

        \end{itemize}

      \item Sender:

        \begin{itemize}

          \item Sequence number added to packet

          \item Two sequence numbers will suffice

          \item Must check if received ACK/NAK corrupted

          \item Sender must ``remember'' whether last sent packet had sequence number of 0 or 1

        \end{itemize}

      \item Receiver:

        \begin{itemize}

          \item Must check if received packet is duplicate

            \begin{itemize}

              \item Receiver must remember whether 0 or 1 is expected packet sequence number

            \end{itemize}

          \item If duplicate, send ACK to force sender to move on

          \item Note: receiver can not know if its last NAK/ACK received ok at sender

        \end{itemize}

      \item A similar protocol without NAKs may be developed:

        \begin{itemize}

          \item Instead of NAK, receiver sends ACK for last packet received OK

            \begin{itemize}

              \item Receiver must explicitly include in the ACK the sequence number of packet being ACKed

            \end{itemize}

          \item Duplicate ACK at sender results in same action as NAK: retransmit current packet

          \item TCP uses this approach to be NAK-free

        \end{itemize}

      \item This protocol may be further developed:

        \begin{itemize}

          \item Approach: sender waits ``reasonable'' amount of time for ACK

          \item Only retransmit if no expected ACK received in this time

          \item If packet (or ACK) just delayed (not lost):

            \begin{itemize}

              \item Retransmission will be duplicate, but sequence number already handles this

              \item Receiver must specify sequence number of packet being ACKed

            \end{itemize}

          \item Requires countdown timer to interrupt after “reasonable” amount of time (timeout)

        \end{itemize}

    \end{itemize}

  \item Utility

    \begin{itemize}

      \item For a ``Stop and Wait'' approach, the utility can be defined as:

        $$U_{sender}=\frac{L/R}{RTT+(L/R)}$$

      \item Thus, the performance of stop and wait would not be food if the RTT is high

      \item Stop and wait limits performance of underlying infrastructure

    \end{itemize}

  \item Pipelined Protocols

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Pipelining: sender allows multiple, ``in-flight'', yet-to-be-acknowledged packets

        \begin{itemize}

          \item Range of sequence numbers must be increaseL $k$-bit sequence number in packet header

          \item Buffering at sender and/or receiver

        \end{itemize}

      \item Two generic forms of pipelined protocols: Go-Back-N (GBN) and selective repeat

    \end{itemize}

  \item Go-Back-N

    \begin{itemize}

      \item A ``sliding window'' protocol

      \item Sender window: $N$ consecutive sequence numbers allowed for sent, unacknowledged packets

        \begin{itemize}

          \item Sender window size is $N$

        \end{itemize}

      \item Cumulative ACK: ACK($n$) $\to$ Acknowledges all packets up to $N$, including sequence number $n$

        \begin{itemize}

          \item On receiving ACK($n$) $\to$ move window forward to begin at $n+1$

        \end{itemize}

    \end{itemize}

  \item Selective Repeat

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Sender Window

        \begin{itemize}

          \item $N$ consecutive sequence numbers

          \item Limits sequence numbers of sent, unacknowledged packets

          \item Sender window size is $N$

        \end{itemize}

      \item Sender maintains a timer for each unACKed packet

      \item Sender times-out and retrsnmits individually unACKed packets

      \item Receiver Window

        \begin{itemize}

          \item $N$ consecutive sequence number

          \item Limits sequence numbers of received packets that are accepted

          \item Receiver window size is $N$

        \end{itemize}

      \item Buffers packets, as needed for eventual in-order delivery to upper layer

      \item Receiver individually acknowledges all correctly received packets

    \end{itemize}

  \item Connection-Oriented Transport: TCP

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Point-to-point: one sender, one receiver

      \item Reliable, in-order byte stream:

        \begin{itemize}

          \item No ``message boundaries''

        \end{itemize}

      \item Full duplex data:

        \begin{itemize}

          \item Bi-directional data flow in same connection

          \item MSS: maximum segment size

        \end{itemize}

      \item Cumulative ACKs

      \item Pipelining:

        \begin{itemize}

          \item TCP congestion and flow control set the window size

        \end{itemize}

      \item Connection-oriented

        \begin{itemize}

          \item Handshaking (exchange of control messages) initializes sender and receiver state before data exchange

        \end{itemize}

      \item Flow control

        \begin{itemize}

          \item Sender will not overwhelm receiver

        \end{itemize}

    \end{itemize}

  \item TCP Sequence Numbers and ACKs

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Sequence Numbers:

        \begin{itemize}

          \item Byte stream ``number'' of first byte in segment data

        \end{itemize}

      \item Acknowledgments:

        \begin{itemize}

          \item Piggbacked ACK on the other-direction data segment

          \item Sequence number of the next byte expected from other side

          \item Cumulative ACK

        \end{itemize}

      \item How receiver handles out-of-order segments?

        \begin{itemize}

          \item TCP specifications does not say — up to implementer

          \item In practice: buffer out-of-order segments

        \end{itemize}

    \end{itemize}

  \item TCP RTT and Timeout

    \begin{itemize}

      \item How to set TCP timeout value?

        \begin{enumerate}

          \item Longer than RTT

            \begin{itemize}

              \item But RTT varies

            \end{itemize}

          \item Too short: premature timeout, unnecessary retransmissions

          \item Too long: slow reaction to segment loss

        \end{enumerate}

      \item How to estimate RTT?

        \begin{itemize}

          \item Sample RTT: measured time from segment transmission until ACK receipt

            \begin{itemize}

              \item Ignore retransmissions

              \item Sample RTT may have high variability

            \end{itemize}

          \item Estimated RTT: average of several recent Sample RTT measurements

            \begin{itemize}

              \item Estimates a typical RTT

              \item ``Smoother'' variability

            \end{itemize}

        \end{itemize}

      \item Timeout interval: Estimated RTT plus ``safety margin''

        \begin{itemize}

          \item Large variation in Estimated RTTL want a larger safety margin

            $$Timeout=EstimatedRTT + 4\cdot DevRTT$$

        \end{itemize}

      \item Dev RTT: EWMA of Sample RTT deviation from Estimated RTT:

        $$DevRTT=(1-\beta)\cdot DevRTT+\beta\cdot|SampleRTT-EstimatedRTT|$$

        \begin{itemize}

          \item $\beta$ is typically .25

        \end{itemize}

    \end{itemize}

  \item TCP Sender (Simplified)

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Event: data received from application

      \item Create a segment with sequence number

      \item Sequence number is byte-stream number of first data byte in segment

      \item Start timer if not already running

        \begin{itemize}

          \item Single retransmission timer

          \item Think of timer as for oldest unACKed segment

          \item Expiration interval: TimeOutInterval

        \end{itemize}

      \item Event: timeout

        \begin{itemize}

          \item Retransmit segment that caused timeout

          \item Restart timer: twice the previous value

        \end{itemize}

      \item Event: ACK received

        \begin{itemize}

          \item If ACK acknowledges previously unACKed segments

            \begin{itemize}

              \item Update what is known to be ACKed

            \end{itemize}

        \end{itemize}

    \end{itemize}

  \item TCP Receiver: ACK Generation

    \begin{center}
      \begin{tabular}[H]{|p{.45\textwidth}|p{.45\textwidth}|}
        \hline
        Event at Receiver & TCP Receiver Action\\
        \hline
        Arrival of in-order segment with expected sequence number, All data up to expected sequence number already ACKed & Delayed ACK. Wait up to 500ms for next segment. If no next segment, send ACK\\
        \hline
        Arrival of in-order segment with expected sequence number. Another segment has ACK pending. & Immediately send single cumulative ACK, ACKing both in-order segments\\
        \hline
        Arrival of out-of-order segment higher-that-expeted sequence number: gap detected. & Immediately send duplicate ACK, indicating sequence number of next expected byte\\
        \hline
        Arrival of segment that partially or completely fills a gap. & Immediately send ACK, if segment starts at lower end of gap.\\
        \hline
      \end{tabular}
    \end{center}

  \item TCP Fast Retransmit

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Time-out period often relatively long:

        \begin{itemize}

          \item Long delay before resending lost packet

        \end{itemize}

      \item Detect lost segments via duplicate ACKs

        \begin{itemize}

          \item Sender often sends many segments back-to-back

          \item If segment is lost, there will likely be many duplicate ACKs

        \end{itemize}

      \item If sender receives 3 additional ACKs for same data (``triple duplicate ACKs''), resend unACKed segment with smallest sequence number

    \end{itemize}

  \item TCP Flow Control

    \begin{itemize}

      \item What happens if network layer delivers data faster than application layer removes data from socket buffers? Overflow

      \item Flow control — Receiver controls sender, so sender will notoverflow receiver’s buffer by transmitting too much, too fast

      \item \textsc{RcvBuffer} size set via socket options (typically 4096 bytes)

        \begin{itemize}

          \item Many operating systems auto adjust \textsc{RcvBuffer}

        \end{itemize}

      \item TCP receiver ``advertises'' free buffer space in \textsc{rwnd} field in TCP header

      \item TCP Sender limits amount of unACKed (``in-flight'') data to received \textsc{rwnd}

      \item Guarantees receive buffer will not overflow

    \end{itemize}

  \item TCP Connection Management

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Before exchanging data, sender/receiver ``handshake'':

        \begin{itemize}

          \item Agree to establish connection (each knowing the other is willing to establish connection)

          \item Agree on connection parameters (\textit{e}.\textit{g}.\ starting sequence numbers)

        \end{itemize}

    \end{itemize}

\end{itemize}
